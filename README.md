# Quickcheck

Checklist management tool for engineering teams. Create, share, and track
deployment checklists, incident response procedures, and release gates.

Built as a static web app — no build step, no framework, no runtime
dependencies. Just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript served over a CDN.

---

## What it Does

- Create checklists with sections and items
- Track progress with check/uncheck
- Organise work into workspaces (team collaboration)
- Share checklists with team members in a workspace
- Import checklists from Markdown files
- Download checklists as Markdown
- View team activity feed per workspace
- Dashboard with stats and recent checklist history (cross-workspace)

## Backend & Storage

| Service       | Purpose                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Supabase      | Database (PostgreSQL), Auth, Realtime      |
| Supabase RPC  | Stored procedures for workspaces, invites  |
| localStorage  | Session persistence for workspace ID        |

Supabase handles all user accounts, checklist CRUD, workspace
membership, sharing, and activity feeds. The client SDK
(`@supabase/supabase-js` v2) talks to the API via anonymous
key authentication with row-level security.

## Authentication

- Email & password (built-in Supabase)
- OAuth: Google, GitHub
- Magic link (passwordless)
- PKCE flow with session persistence

## Frontend Stack

Zero dependencies. No React, no Vue, no bundler, no transpiler.

| Language        | Usage                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| HTML5           | Semantic markup, meta tags, CSP headers  |
| CSS3            | Custom properties, flexbox, grid, media queries |
| JavaScript (ES6)| All application logic, DOM, Supabase SDK |

### CSS Architecture

- Global design tokens via custom properties (`--bg`, `--accent`,
  `--radius-lg`, etc.)
- Dark theme by default
- Component-based naming (`.dash-cl-item`, `.sidebar`, `.checklist-view`)
- Desktop-first responsive breakpoints at 1100px, 900px, 800px, 600px

### JavaScript

- Modular file structure (auth, checklist, workspace, db, modal, state, etc.)
- Supabase JS SDK for all database and auth operations
- Custom Markdown parser and serializer (no external library)
- Debounced canvas rendering for the landing page hero

## Features

### Landing Page (Marketing Site)

- Dashboard stats (active, completed, member count, success rate)
- Workspace management (create, rename, delete, invite members)
- Account settings (profile, email, password, notification preferences)

### Workspace System

## Running Locally

This is a static site. No build step needed.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd quickcheck-web
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or: npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.

To use the dashboard, create a Supabase project and update
`auth/config.js` with your project URL and anonymous key.
The database schema is derived from the RPC calls in `workspace.js`
and `db.js`.
